# RVP 

RVP (recursive variance partitioning) is a quantitative batch effect metric
that estimates the proportion of variance associated with batch effects in a
data set (the "RVP" value of a data set).

To determine whether batch effects are statistically significant in a data
set, a permutation test can be performed by setting `nperm` to a number
above 100. `RVP` is an S3 generic function; methods can be added for new
classes. S3 methods for class: matrix, data frame, `SummarizedExperiment`,
`SingleCellExperiment` and `Seurat` are provided.
