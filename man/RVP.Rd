\usage{
RVP(x, ...)

\method{RVP}{default}(x, batch, cls = NULL, nperm = 0, use.sparse = FALSE, ...)

\method{RVP}{Seurat}(x, batchname, classname = NULL, nperm = 0, use.sparse = FALSE, ...)

\method{RVP}{SummarizedExperiment}(
  x,
  batchname,
  classname = NULL,
  assayname = NULL,
  nperm = 0,
  use.sparse = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object to calculate RVP for.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass to S3 methods.}

\item{batch}{vector, indicating the batch information of samples.}

\item{cls}{vector or list of vectors with class information of samples.}

\item{nperm}{numeric indicating number of permutations to simulate in the
Monte Carlo permutation test. We recommend a value no less than 1000.
By default, no permutation test is performed.}

\item{use.sparse}{logical indicating whether to use sparse matrices when
 computing RVP. N.B. Using sparse matrices may lead to slight increase
in run time.}

\item{batchname}{character, name of column in metadata indicating batch.}

\item{classname}{character, name of column/s in metadata indicating class.}

\item{assayname}{character, name of assay to use. By default the first
assay is used.}
}
\value{
List containing the following components:
  \describe{
    \item{`RVP`}{the proportion of variance associated with batch effects.}
    \item{`sum.squares`}{matrix of sum of squares between batch and total
      sum of squares for all features.}
    \item{`p.value`}{p-value of permutation test}
    \item{`null.distribution`}{numeric, null distribution of RVP values.}
  }
  Last two components are only present if permuation test is performed.
}
\description{
`RVP` calculates the proportion of variance associated with batch effects
in a data set (the "RVP" value of a data set). To determine whether batch
effects are statistically significant in a data set, a permutation test can
be performed by setting `nperm` to a number above 100. `RVP` is
an S3 generic function; methods can be added for new classes. S3 methods
for class: array-like objects (default), `SummarizedExperiment`, 
`SingleCellExperiment` and `Seurat` are provided.
}
\details{
Default S3 method is for class data frame or matrix with
  dimensions (nfeatures, nsamples).

S3 method for `SummarizedExperiment` is applicable for the
  `SingleExperiment` class as well, as it inherits from the
  `SummarizedExperiment` class.
